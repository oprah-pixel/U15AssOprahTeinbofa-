        <h1>Events & Projects</h1>
        <p>At Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester, we believe that Slovak culture should be experienced, not just learned.should be experienced, not just learned. That’s why we organise a variety of events for everyone—families, children, adults, and individuals who simply want to connect with Slovak heritage, make new friends, and enjoy great company.

Whether you’re a parent wanting to engage your child in Slovak traditions, a single professional looking to expand your social circle, or someone who just loves Slovak culture, our variety of events and workshops provides a welcoming space where people can enjoy themselves, have fun, eat traditional Slovak food, and build lasting connections.

Some come for the cultural experience, some come to practise their Slovak, and others just come to enjoy good company over a coffee or a glass of wine. Whatever your reason, you are always welcome.</p>
