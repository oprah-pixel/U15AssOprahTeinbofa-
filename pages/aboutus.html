We are here to keep our heritage alive, to ensure that children growing up abroad don’t lose their connection to their roots, and to create a place where Slovak culture thrives—even far from home. Education is at the heart of what we do, but our purpose extends even further. We are here to bridge the gap between the UK and Slovak education systems, ensuring that children who may one day return to Slovakia can transition smoothly. Above all, we are here to create a community—one that welcomes, supports, and celebrates Slovak language, traditions, and the people who cherish them.</p>
